# About Enablis Compass

Enablis Compass serves as the central navigation system for our organization's information security management system (ISMS). It provides guidance, direction, and clarity on how we protect information assets while enabling business success.

## Purpose

The Compass was created to:

- Provide clear direction on security policies and procedures
- Ensure consistent application of security practices
- Support compliance with regulatory requirements
- Enable team members to make informed security decisions

## How to Use This Resource

The Compass is organized into three main sections:

- **Policies**: The foundational principles and rules that govern our security approach
- **Procedures**: Step-by-step instructions for implementing our security policies
- **Guides**: Practical advice and best practices for specific security topics
