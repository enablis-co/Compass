## 3. ISMS Governance Approach

### ISMS Leadership Structure

Our ISMS governance follows a straightforward structure that builds on Enablis's existing leadership framework. The Group CEO provides top-level leadership and accountability, setting the tone for the entire organization's approach to security. The ISMS Committee, chaired by the CTO, serves as the central decision-making body for security matters, bringing together leaders from across the business to ensure security is integrated into all aspects of our operations.

Day-to-day management of the ISMS falls to the CTO, who coordinates implementation and ensures security activities align with business objectives. Individual control owners take responsibility for specific aspects of security within their areas of expertise, creating a distributed but coordinated approach to security management.

This structure balances centralized governance with distributed implementation, recognizing that security works best when it's integrated into normal business activities rather than treated as a separate function.

### ISMS Committee Composition and Operation

The ISMS Committee brings together Enablis's leadership team to provide direction and oversight for our security program. Chaired by the CTO, the committee includes the Group CEO, Group Commercial Director, Chief Customer Officer, Delivery Director, Tech Delivery Director, and Head of Operations (upon return from maternity leave).

The committee meets quarterly at minimum, with additional meetings when significant security matters arise. Meetings follow a consistent agenda covering security performance metrics, risk register reviews, incident assessments, and improvement opportunities. Decisions are made by consensus where possible, with the Chair having the deciding vote when necessary.

This collaborative approach ensures security decisions benefit from diverse perspectives across the business while maintaining clear accountability for outcomes.

## 4. Key Roles and Responsibilities

### Group CEO

The Group CEO serves as the ultimate authority for information security at Enablis, setting the tone for the organization's security culture. This role is responsible for approving the Information Security Policy, ensuring the ISMS aligns with business objectives, and providing adequate resources for security implementation.

With final approval authority for the ISMS scope and policies, the Group CEO makes critical decisions about resource allocation and high-risk acceptance. This executive sponsorship is essential for an effective security program, demonstrating to clients, partners, and employees that security is a top priority for Enablis.

### Chief Technology Officer as ISMS Manager

The CTO takes on dual roles as both ISMS Committee Chair and ISMS Manager, providing continuity and technical depth to our security program. As ISMS Manager, the CTO handles day-to-day management of the ISMS, ensuring compliance with ISO 27001 requirements and reporting on security performance to leadership.

The role encompasses overseeing risk assessment and treatment, coordinating internal audits and management reviews, maintaining ISMS documentation, and leading security awareness efforts. With authority to develop and maintain ISMS documentation, allocate resources within the approved security budget, and approve low to medium risk acceptance, the CTO serves as the linchpin of our security program.

### Technical Security Leadership

The Tech Delivery Director brings technical expertise to our security program, implementing technical controls and developing security standards that protect our systems and data. This role oversees security architecture, contributes to incident response for technical issues, coordinates security testing, and ensures secure development practices.

With authority to define technical security standards, approve technical control implementation, direct technical aspects of incident response, and approve secure development practices, the Tech Delivery Director translates security requirements into practical technical solutions that work in our environment.

### Client-Facing Security Roles

The Chief Customer Officer takes the lead on client-facing security matters, managing client security requirements and communications to ensure we meet our clients' expectations. This includes security aspects of client onboarding, maintaining client security documentation, and embedding security into service delivery.

With authority to define client security processes, approve client security documentation, manage client security expectations, and direct client security incident communications, the CCO ensures security enhances rather than hinders our client relationships.

The Delivery Director complements this by integrating security into our project delivery methodology, conducting project security risk assessments, promoting security awareness among project teams, and ensuring security considerations are addressed during project handover. This role ensures security is woven into the fabric of how we deliver for clients, rather than being treated as a separate consideration.

### Commercial Security Oversight

The Group Commercial Director oversees security in our business relationships, ensuring security requirements are appropriately addressed in contracts and commercial agreements. This includes supplier security management, security in procurement processes, and handling commercial aspects of security incidents.

With authority to define security requirements in contracts, approve supplier security assessments, direct supplier security remediation, and manage security aspects of commercial relationships, this role ensures our business partnerships support rather than undermine our security posture.

### Administrative Support

The Admin Team provides essential support for ISMS operation, managing documentation, meeting administration, training records, compliance monitoring, and metric tracking. This role ensures the operational aspects of the ISMS run smoothly, with proper documentation and evidence collection to support certification activities.

Upon return from maternity leave, the Head of Operations will assume many of these responsibilities, providing more strategic direction to the administrative aspects of security management.

## 5. Control Ownership

Rather than centralizing all security responsibilities, our approach distributes control ownership across the organization to those best positioned to implement and monitor specific security aspects.

### Technical Controls

The Tech Delivery Director owns several technical control areas, including access control and identity management, communications security, and cloud security. This ownership involves implementing the access control policy, managing user access provisioning, ensuring appropriate authentication, and reviewing access rights.

For communications and cloud security, responsibilities include network and email security management, remote access security, encryption implementation, and cloud security configuration. This consolidated ownership of technical controls ensures consistency in our approach while leveraging specialized expertise.

### Operational Controls

Human Resource security falls to the Admin Team (transitioning to the Head of Operations upon return), covering security in employment processes, awareness coordination, onboarding and offboarding security aspects, and training records.

Physical and environmental security is managed by the Office Administrator, who oversees office security, secure areas, environmental controls, physical access monitoring, and visitor management.

Business continuity is owned by the Chief Customer Officer, who develops continuity planning, disaster recovery procedures, business impact analysis, and resilience measures, ensuring our ability to maintain service to clients during disruptions.

### Governance Controls

Incident management is jointly owned by the CTO and Tech Delivery Director, combining management oversight with technical expertise. This includes incident response coordination, classification and reporting, investigation, documentation, and post-incident review.

Compliance and risk management are owned by the CTO, who monitors legal and regulatory requirements, contractual obligations, and data protection responsibilities while coordinating the overall risk management process, including assessment methodology, treatment planning, and register maintenance.

This distributed but coordinated approach to control ownership ensures security responsibilities align with existing roles and expertise while maintaining a comprehensive security posture.

## 6. All Staff Responsibilities

Security is not just the responsibility of leadership and designated control owners—it requires participation from everyone at Enablis. All employees, contractors, and third parties are responsible for:

Everyone who works with or for Enablis has an important role in our security posture. This includes complying with security policies, protecting information assets they use, promptly reporting security incidents and weaknesses, completing required security training, and contributing to continuous security improvement.

We empower all staff to report security concerns without fear of reprisal, question activities that may impact security, and suggest security improvements. This inclusive approach recognizes that those closest to the work often have the best insight into potential security enhancements.

## 7. External Roles

We recognize the value of external expertise in strengthening our security program. External security consultants may be engaged to provide specialized security expertise, support ISO 27001 implementation, conduct security assessments, advise on best practices, and assist with technical implementation.

External auditors play a crucial role in verifying our compliance with ISO 27001, identifying non-conformities, and providing improvement recommendations. They have authority to access necessary information, report findings directly to leadership, and verify corrective action implementation.

These external perspectives help ensure our security approach remains robust and aligned with industry standards.

## 8. Competence and Development

### Role-Specific Competence Requirements

Each ISMS role requires specific knowledge and skills to be effective:

The ISMS Manager needs a solid understanding of ISO 27001 requirements, information security risk management knowledge, leadership and project management skills, and a deep understanding of Enablis's business and operations.

The Technical Security Lead requires technical security expertise, cloud security knowledge, secure development understanding, and security testing experience.

The ISMS Administrator needs documentation management skills, attention to detail, organizational abilities, and a basic understanding of ISMS requirements.

ISMS Committee members must understand their area's security requirements, make effective security decisions, manage resources, and understand risk management principles.

### Developing Security Competence

We take a practical approach to developing security competence across the organization. This includes regular skills assessment against requirements, role-specific training provided as needed, external expertise to supplement internal capabilities, knowledge sharing among team members, and support for security certifications and professional development.

This investment in security knowledge and skills ensures our team can effectively implement and maintain our security controls while keeping pace with evolving threats and best practices.

## 9. Decision-Making Framework

To ensure clear accountability and efficient decision-making, we use a RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) model for key ISMS activities. This framework clarifies who does the work, who is ultimately answerable, who provides input, and who needs to be kept updated for each security activity.

For example, the CTO is accountable for risk assessment while working with others who provide input and support. The Group CEO is accountable for policy approval, with the CTO responsible for development and others consulted or informed as appropriate. This clarity prevents confusion and ensures efficient security operations.

The full RACI matrix in the appendix provides a comprehensive view of responsibilities across all major ISMS activities, creating a clear map of security roles throughout the organization.

## 10. Conclusion

Our approach to security roles and responsibilities reflects Enablis's culture of trust, expertise, and client focus. By integrating security responsibilities into existing roles rather than creating a separate security bureaucracy, we embed security into the fabric of our organization.

This structure provides clear accountability while recognizing that security works best when it's a shared responsibility. It enables us to maintain a robust security posture that protects our clients and our business while supporting rather than hindering our ability to deliver exceptional digital products.
