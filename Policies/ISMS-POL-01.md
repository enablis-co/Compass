## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose

This Information Security Management Policy establishes the framework for protecting information assets at Enablis while enabling the technical excellence and innovation that drives our business. It provides the foundation for our Information Security Management System (ISMS) and demonstrates our commitment to safeguarding both our own and our clients' information.

### 1.2 Scope

This policy applies to:

- All Enablis employees, contractors, and temporary staff
- All information assets owned, processed, or managed by Enablis
- Client information and systems accessed or managed by Enablis
- All locations from which Enablis business is conducted, including remote environments
- All technology systems, infrastructure, and services utilized in Enablis operations

## 2. Information Security Principles

Enablis applies these core principles to our security approach:

### 2.1 Trust with Appropriate Controls

We hire exceptional people and trust their judgment. Our security framework balances this trust with appropriate controls that protect information assets without impeding innovation or delivery.

### 2.2 Risk-Based Security

We focus security investments where they provide the greatest risk reduction, allocating resources based on the actual threats and potential impacts to our business and clients.

### 2.3 Security by Design

We integrate security considerations from the outset of projects and processes rather than retrofitting them later, making security a natural part of our technical excellence.

### 2.4 Client-Centric Security

We adapt our security approach to meet the specific needs of each client engagement, recognizing that different clients and projects have different security requirements.

### 2.5 Continuous Improvement

We regularly review and enhance our security controls in response to evolving threats, business changes, and lessons learned.
